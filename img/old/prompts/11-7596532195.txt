A vivid, digital artwork that merges elements of nature and technology. The subject is a dense, intricate web of interconnected, glowing circuits, stretching across a vast expanse of a nebula. The circuits are made of pure energy, pulsating with life and brighter than the surrounding cosmic bodies. The nebula itself is depicted in a highly detailed, hyperrealistic style, with swirling clouds of gas and dust illuminated by the glow of the circuits. The composition is dynamic, creating a sense of movement and flow. The overall style is reminiscent of a cross between a surrealist painting and a sci-fi movie set. The scene should evoke a sense of awe and wonder, capturing the essence of both the natural and technological aspects of the universe.
